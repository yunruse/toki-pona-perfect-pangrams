# Toki Pona Perfect Pangrams

![logo.png]("Toki Pona Perfect Pangrams!")

The language Toki Pona has only 14 letters in its alphabet, and around 140 words. Its syllable structure is well-defined: a syllable consists of an consonant (`ptksmnljw`) followed by a vowel (`aiueo`) followed by an optional `n`. A word can start without a consonant, and the sequences `ji`, `wu`, `wo`, `ti`, `nn` and `nm` are disallowed so that the language is maximally understandable to all listeners.

A pangram is a sentence containing all letters. In English, this is most well known as "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." Toki Pona has them too: for example, _waso mute pi jan kali_, "many birds of a fisherman".
While 3 vowels are necessarily repeated, this 17-letter pangram is said to be "perfect", as it uses each consonant only once: 8 syllables, one with a `n` at the end. In Toki Pona, all words have stress on the first syllable, so if we find any pangrams with four words of two syllables, we can put them in a [TMNT logo](http://glench.com/tmnt/#waso_mute_pi_jan_kali), so that's neat.

In Toki Pona, words can be placed almost anywhere. If you're on the hunt for a good pangram, it's probably easier to see each permutation once – many word combinations are hard to make anything meaningful from, so it saves a lot of unnecessary duplicates.
